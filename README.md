this is low effort cause its like 12:20AM 

the backend code is just what exists in the lambda on the AWS which has the api calls and stuff

i cant get it to generate the image properly because for some reason it cant read the 15.npy file because its "allow_pickled=false" but when i tell it to allow pickle, it cant read it because its a pickled file

i dont even know what this means and im too dead to find out. if anyone can figure out what is wrong with my backend code, you'll be a saint in my eyes

i hate web dev and i hate aws even more now
